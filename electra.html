        <p>
        It's night again
        </p>
        <p>
        Once again, she makes herself stylish and shine
        </p>
        <p>Once again, in the impenetrable darkness</p>
        <p>Once again, the darkness fettered your soul</p>
        <p>She loves to take control of you</p>
        <p>She loves to play you in freak show</p>
        <p>We, doomed to be controlled</p>
        <p>To be leashed</p>
        <p>If I kill one man,</p>
        <p>  </p>
        <p>Then I killed two</p>
        <p>My boots on her breast</p>
        <p>And crushed her chest</p>
        <p>Haven't you died? Right before your birth</p>
        <p>Haven't you see? Or haven't you cry</p>
        <p>Her beating heart, in her chest</p>
        <p>That's the reason, the only reason</p>
        <p>Show your mercy!</p>
        <p>Let my heart beat just a little bit longer!</p>
        <p>Please!</p>
        <p>And still...</p>
        <p>Her moaning got weaker and weaker</p>
        <p>  </p>
        <p>Daddy, I shall murder you</p>
        <p>I ought to slay you</p>
        <p>Haven't you died before my birth?</p>
        <p>Then we're forever together</p>
        <p>If I killed one man, then,</p>
        <p>I killed two</p>
        <p>Her beating heart, in her chest</p>
        <p>That's the reason, the only reason</p>
        <p>My boots on her breast</p>
        <p>And crushed her chest</p>
        <p>Her moaning got weaker and weaker</p>
