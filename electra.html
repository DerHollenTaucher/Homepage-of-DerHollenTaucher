        <p>
        As the spring wang down
        </p>
        <p>
        Silence return
        </p>
        <p>As blindness whispers to us</p>
        <p>Her voice's aura grey</p>
        <p>She had bestowed us so much hope</p>
        <p>And gave us so much to rely on</p>
        <p>The melody of this world</p>
        <p>Was sang by her to us</p>
        <p>It's the only song we had ever known</p>
        <p>And it's the only song we are able to sing</p>
        <p>The same lyrics</p>
        <p>The same rythem</p>
        <p>And still the same lyre</p>
        <p>But somehow - what anything else do we care about?</p>
        <p>Feeling no remorse</p>
        <p>This song is authentically our whole world</p>
        <p>And we had never know about any other songs</p>
        <p>But once silent...</p>
        <p>Our world anew</p>
        <p>Solace in blindness</p>
        <p>We can still hear in the dark</p>
        <p>We listen to her melody</p>
        <p>We are just blind rather than deaf</p>
        <p>This song built our whole world</p>
        <p>Which was played by her cosmically</p>
        <p>And everyday - </p>
        <p>We must make ourselves dance</p>
        <p>By following the rythem of her gears</p>

        <h1>Electra</h1>
        <!-- NOW I made the chapters -->
        <p>It's night again
        <p>Once again, she makes herself stylish and shine
<p>Once again, in the impenetrable darkness</p>
<p>Once again, the darkness fettered your soul</p>
<p>She loves to take control of you</p>
<p>She loves to play you in freak show</p>
<p>We, doomed to be controlled</p>
<p>To be leashed</p>
<p>If I kill one man,</p>
<p>Then I killed two</p>
<p>My boots on her breast</p>
<p>And crushed her chest</p>
<p>Haven't you died? Right before your birth</p>
<p>Haven't you see? Or haven't you cry</p>
<p>Her beating heart, in her chest</p>
<p>That's the reason, the only reason</p>
<p>Show your mercy!</p>
<p>Let my heart beat just a little bit longer!</p>
<p>Please!</p>
<p>And still...</p>
<p>Her moaning got weaker and weaker</p>
<p>Daddy, I shall murder you</p>
<p>I ought to slay you</p>
<p>Haven't you died before my birth?</p>
<p>Then we're forever together</p>
<p>If I killed one man, then,</p>
<p>I killed two</p>
<p>Her beating heart, in her chest</p>
<p>That's the reason, the only reason</p>
<p>My boots on her breast</p>
<p>And crushed her chest</p>
<p>Her moaning got weaker and weaker</p>
